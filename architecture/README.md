# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural documentation, infographics, and presentations for the google-gmail-tool project.

## Generation Process

The documentation artifacts in this directory were generated using the following workflow:

### 1. Source Code Concatenation

All Python (`.py`) and Markdown (`.md`) files from the repository were concatenated into a single file (`total.md`) with `---` separators between each file:

```bash
# Concatenate all Python files
find . -type f -name "*.py" > total.md

# Append all Markdown files (excluding total.md itself)
find . -type f -name "*.md" ! -name "total.md" >> total.md
```

This creates a comprehensive single-file view of the entire codebase for AI analysis.

### 2. NotebookLM Upload

The concatenated `total.md` file was uploaded to Google NotebookLM to create a knowledge base about the project.

### 3. Artifact Generation

Using NotebookLM's capabilities, the following artifacts were generated with specific prompts:

## Generated Artifacts

### Infographic: "Architecture of the google-gmail-tool"

**Prompt:**
```
Describe the architecture of the CLI, modules, components, classes, boundaries, SOLID
```

**Purpose:** Visual representation of the system architecture showing:
- CLI structure and command groups
- Module organization and dependencies
- Component relationships
- Class hierarchies
- Architectural boundaries
- SOLID principles implementation

**Download:** After generation in NotebookLM, save to `./architecture/infographic-architecture.pdf` (or appropriate format)

---

### Infographic: "Master Your Workspace"

**Prompt:** None (auto-generated)

**Purpose:** Overview infographic automatically generated by NotebookLM showing key insights and workspace organization.

**Download:** After generation in NotebookLM, save to `./architecture/infographic-workspace.pdf` (or appropriate format)

---

### Presentation: "google-gmail-tool"

**Prompt:**
```
Explain the cli, the architecture, the functions and features, the implementation, use cases, flow charts, design, and provide critical feedback
```

**Purpose:** Comprehensive presentation covering:
- CLI interface and commands
- System architecture
- Functions and features
- Implementation details
- Use cases and examples
- Flow charts and diagrams
- Design decisions
- Critical analysis and feedback

**Download:** After generation in NotebookLM, save to `./architecture/presentation-overview.pdf` (or appropriate format)

---

### Presentation: "google gmail tool - an architectural deep dive"

**Prompt:**
```
Create a presentation about the architecture, components, functionality, boundaries, implementation details, and possible improvements and future features when combined with Generative AI like Gemini 3
```

**Purpose:** Deep technical dive covering:
- Detailed architecture analysis
- Component breakdown
- Functionality documentation
- System boundaries
- Implementation details
- Areas for improvement
- Future features and roadmap
- Generative AI integration possibilities (Gemini 3)

**Download:** After generation in NotebookLM, save to `./architecture/presentation-deep-dive.pdf` (or appropriate format)

## How to Use

1. **Generate artifacts in NotebookLM** using the prompts above
2. **Download the generated files** (PDFs, PNGs, etc.)
3. **Place them in this directory** with descriptive filenames
4. **Update this README** with links to the actual files

## Recommended File Naming

- `infographic-architecture.pdf` - Architecture infographic
- `infographic-workspace.pdf` - Workspace infographic
- `presentation-overview.pdf` - Overview presentation
- `presentation-deep-dive.pdf` - Architectural deep dive presentation

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: AI can analyze the entire codebase at once
- **Visual Documentation**: Auto-generated infographics and presentations
- **Fresh Perspective**: AI provides unbiased architectural insights
- **Quick Updates**: Regenerate when code changes significantly
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Professional presentations for non-technical audiences
